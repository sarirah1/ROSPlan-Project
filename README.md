# ROSPlan-Project

This repository contains the code for the MSc Master's project for Goal Recognition in ROS using ROSPlan. It is organised as follows:

* Agricultural-Farm
  * This is a new dataset created by extending the Harpia domain Model [1]. It is a Numeric Planning domain model that is formalised in PDDL+. It contains 20 different recognition problems; 5 initial states are defined with 4 recognition problems for each initial state.
* Harpia
  * This is the Harpia dataset. It contains 20 different recognition problems; 5 initial states are defined with 4 recognition problems for each initial state.
* launch
  * These contain the launch files for the Goal Mirroring Approach (for both datasets) and Diverse Mirroring (for Harpia dataset
* scripts
  * These contain the python scripts for the Goal Mirroring Algorithms developed in ROSPlan: Goal Mirroring and Diverse Mirroring.
